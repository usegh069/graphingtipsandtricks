# API Reference

This section contains detailed API reference documentation for the CCPorted codebase. The documentation is generated from TypeScript declaration files and JSDoc comments.

Each module's API documentation includes:

- Type definitions
- Function signatures
- Interface descriptions
- Parameter details
- Return value information

The API reference is organized by module, corresponding to the JavaScript files in the static directory.

## Using the API Reference

The API reference is intended for developers who are working with the CCPorted codebase. It provides detailed information about the available APIs, their parameters, and return values.

When using the API reference, keep in mind:

1. The documentation is generated from TypeScript declaration files
2. The actual implementation is in JavaScript
3. Type information is provided for development and documentation purposes

## API Stability

The APIs documented here are considered stable for the current version of the codebase. However, they may change in future versions. Always refer to the latest documentation when working with the codebase.

## Contributing to the API Documentation

If you find any issues or have suggestions for improving the API documentation, please submit a pull request or open an issue on the GitHub repository.
