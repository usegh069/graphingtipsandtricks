        and Readers</strong></h1>
<p>Monumetric LLC has a partnership agreement with this Site which you linked from for the purposes of placing
    advertising on the Site. This Advertising Privacy Policy explains how Monumetric uses your data and supersedes any
    other language on the Site (if any) with respect to the data privacy practices of Monumetric. Monumetric uses
    industry standard tools for the placement and serving of ads, including those provided by Google, Inc. and its
    affiliates. We publish interest-based advertisements on this Site; that is, ads that are tailored to reflect your
    interests. To help make the advertising on the Site you linked from more relevant to you, Monumetric, Google and our
    other Advertising Partners may track your behavior on this site from which you linked and on other websites across
    the Internet using cookies.</p>
<p>A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web
    browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests
    a page from the server. Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be
    stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the
    expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser
    is closed. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal
    information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.</p>
<p>By using the site from which you linked, you consent to the use of such cookies and the sharing of data captured by
    such cookies with Monumetric, Google, and our site’s other third party partners. You can view, delete or add
    interest categories associated with your browser by visiting: <a
        href="https://adssettings.google.com/">https://adssettings.google.com</a>. You can also opt out of the network
    cookie using those settings or using the Network Advertising Initiative’s multi-cookie opt-out mechanism at: <a
        href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/">http://optout.networkadvertising.org</a>. However, these opt-out
    mechanisms themselves use cookies, and if you clear the cookies from your browser your opt-out will not be
    maintained.</p>
<p>This website uses cookies to:<br>
    1) Identify you as a returning user and to count your visits in traffic statistics analysis<br>
    2) Remember your custom display preferences (such as whether you prefer comments to display all-collapsed or
    not)<br>
    4) Provide other usability features, including tracking whether you’ve already given your consent to cookies</p>
<p>Enabling cookies is not strictly necessary for the website to work but it will provide you with a better browsing
    experience. The cookie-related information is not used to identify you personally and is not used for any purpose
    other than those described here.</p>
<p>There may also be other types of cookies created after you’ve visited this website. This site uses Google Analytics,
    a popular web analytics service that uses cookies to help to analyze how users use the site. The information
    generated by the cookie about your use of this website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored
    by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use
    of other website, compiling reports on website activity, and providing other services relating to website activity
    and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or
    where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google undertakes not to associate your IP
    address with any other data held by Google.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong><br>
    This site has third-party advertising companies serving ads to you when you visit. These companies may store
    information about your visits here and to other websites in order to provide you with relevant advertisements about
    goods and services. For example, if they know what ads you are shown while visiting this site, they can be careful
    not to show you the same ones repeatedly.</p>
<p>These companies may employ cookies and other identifiers to gather information which measures advertising
    effectiveness. The information is generally not personally identifiable unless, for example, you provide personally
    identifiable information to them through an ad or an email message.</p>
<p>They do not associate your interaction with unaffiliated sites with your identity in providing you with
    interest-based ads.</p>
<p>This site does not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party sites. Advertisers and other
    third parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume
    that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content
    is directed towards (for example, readers in the Pacific Northwest who read certain types of articles). Also, some
    third-party cookies may provide them with information about you (such as the sites where you have been shown ads or
    demographic information) from offline and online sources that they may use to provide you more relevant and useful
    advertising.</p>
<p>To learn more about what options you have about limiting the gathering of information by third-party ad networks, you
    can consult the website of the <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a>.
</p>
<p>You can opt out of participating in interest-based advertising networks but opting out does not mean you will no
    longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the companies from which you opted out will no longer customize
    ads based on your interests and web usage patterns using cookie-based technology.</p>
